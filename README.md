# Robotic Arm Prototype for Space Tango
This repository contains the prototype for a robotic arm system developed in 2018 for Space Tango's CEO, Twyman Clements, intended for deployment aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

## Project Overview
The system was designed to meet the ISS mandate requiring the extraction and initiation of Tango Labs to be fully unmanned. To achieve this, the project featured:

- A robotic arm capable of autonomous operation.
- A redesigned setup for individually regulated microgravity units to ensure precise control in the space environment.

## Project Status
Despite meeting all technical and operational demands, the automation project was ultimately scrapped due to funding limitations on Space Tango's part.
